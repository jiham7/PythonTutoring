#The code below is an example of choosing three variables and redefining them using 
# functions and new references. 
#Write out the code for them and make them solve and guess by hand
#Then let them make their own variables

a = 5
b = 10
c = 2

a = a - 2
b = b - a 
c = a*b + 4

a = b + 4
b = c - 4
c = c*3

print(a) 
print(b) 
print(c)
