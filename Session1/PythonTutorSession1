Session 1 (11/8): Setup, Math functions, Variables, String
-Setup
	- Make account in Repl.it
	- Show how script and shell work
- Difference between script and shell
	- script: has code
	- shell: manages file of code, runs code
	- use print statements to show on shell
- Python is space specific and has specific settings to run
	- syntax: Spelling / grammar of coding language
	- Examples of code that doesnt run with improper spacing
	- introduce Print statements
- Math functions
	- Using python as calculator: (+, -, (), /, *)
	- different types of numbers: int, float
	- special functions
		- // gets rid of remainder
		- % remainder
		- ** is power of 
	-Review: Pop quiz Math test
- Variables 
	-a placeholder of information of same type
	- "=" is to assign
	-can be used in math functions
	-can work with other variables
	-can be used to hold strings
	- Review: guess which variable is the highest number
- String
	-can be used to represent words with '' or ""
	- use \ to escape single or double quotes
	- two strings next to each each are automatically concatenated 
		- Ex: "john" "doe" => "johndoe"
	- Strings can have math functions to them
		- "+" means concatenate
		- "*" means to multiply the string 
	-String is basically a list of letters
		-a list from 0- length
		- show number system of Strings 
			-Ex: "Python"[0:2] = "Py"
			-Ex: "Python"[1] = 2nd position since starts from 0
